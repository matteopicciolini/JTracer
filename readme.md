 <h1 align="center">  Ray Tracing Project </h1> <br>


*Specular view of deer and cat, realized with two triangle mashes*

This is a project developed by Matteo Picciolini and [Francesco Villa][1] to reproduce some photorealistic images by using Numerical Methods. This came from a course we attended in Unimi, called *Numeric calculus for photorealistic images generation*, directed by our professor [Maurizio Tomasi][2].
Our library is written in java, a very powerful lenguage we learned in this course.

## Overview 

The purpose of the course is precisely the generation of photorealistic images using a Ray Tracer, a library provided on this website called J-Tracer, written in Java.
The algorithm used employs the backwards ray tracing method, where for each pixel of the desired image, a user-defined number of rays are launched, tracing the geometric path of the light rays back to the source. The presence of a camera behind the screen is simulated to form a proper image.

Our code allows for the implementation of various types of materials (we will provide the complete table in a `.txt` file later) as well as different types of shapes, such as spheres, planes, cubes, various types of conics, triangles, and triangle meshes (the use of triangle meshes will be thoroughly explained).
Once the desired shapes are defined and the scene is rendered using the methods described earlier, the resulting image is in HDR format (a `.pfm` file), and subsequently converted into an LDR file such as `.jpg` or .png based on the user's needs.

## Prerequisites


Using the Java language and the Gradle compiler, our luck was that we didn't need to install external libraries. In fact, it was enough to include the necessary libraries for converting from HDR to LDR images and for running the tests in the Gradle.build file.
Having Java 18 correttoy installed and Gradle v7.6.1 are the only prerequisites to use this program.

- [Gradle-compiler](https://gradle.org/releases/)

## Usage

To use this library, you need to clone the repository into a local folder using the command:

    git clone git@github.com:matteopicciolini/ray_tracing.git

Then, you can run the command 

    gradlew test
    
to verify that the package functions correctly by executing the tests.
The main feature of the program is the ***renderer mode***, which reads an externali file `.txt` containing the scene that will be renderized. It is necessary to use this command to activate the renderer mode

     gradlew run --args --all_the_arguments_needed

  now it follows the full list fo args and their default settings:
  
  - `--angle-deg`            float: Angle of view. Default: 0.
  - `--algorithm`            string: Algorithm of rendering. Default: pathTracer.
  - `--antialiasing`         bool: Use antialiasing algorithm. Default: false.
  - `--convertToPNG`         bool: At the end of the program execution, automatically convert the PFM file to PNG.
                               Default: true.
  - `--deletePFM`            bool: At the end of the program execution, keep only the LDR image, deleting the PFM.
                               Default: false.
  - `--factor`               float: Multiplicative factor. Default: 0.18.
  - `--flushFrequence`       int: Frequency of flush (expressed in number of processed pixels) of the progress bar.
                               Default: 100         
  - `--gamma`                float: Exponent for gamma-correction. Default: 2.2.
  - `--help`                 Show this help message and exit.
  - `--height`               int: Height of the image. Default: 480.
  - `--luminosity`           float: Luminosity of the image. 	 Default: It is calculated for the pathTracer; otherwise,
                               it is set to 0.5.
  - `--maxDepth`             int: Maximum recursion depth
  - `--numRays`              int: Number of rays per pixel
  - `--nThreads`             int: Number of threads to use for parallelization. Default: 4.
  - `--orthogonal`          bool: Use an orthogonal camera. Default: false.
  - `--output`       string: Path of the output ldr file. Default: img.pfm.
  - `--parallelAntialiasing` bool: Parallelize antialiasing algorithm. Default: false.
  - `--russianRouletteLimit` int: Russian roulette limit. Default: 3.
  - `--version`              Print version information and exit.
  - `--width`                int: Width of the image. Default: 480.

- ### Examples

- ### Demo mode
   This peculiar mode is usually called where there is some need tu build a quick scene without pass trough the `.txt` file.
   To strart running **demo mode**, the user should use the main command:

      gradlew run demo --args

  To obtain the full list of arguments the command is the following:

      gradlew run demo -h

- ### Shapes
   The complete list of available shapes are the following:
  - Sphere
  - Planes
  - Cubes
  - Quadratics shapes
  - Trinagles
  - Triangle Meshes

Concerning about the last shape, using triangle meshes is a bit complex than other shapes. In facts, in order to build a scene with some specific shapes (tetrahedron, icosahedron and all the possible shapes like deers or cats) it is necessary to include a particular file `.txt` with the following structure:

```
# vertices
v 0.00 0.00 0.00
v 1.00 0.00 0.00
v 0.00 1.00 0.00
v 0.00 0.00 1.00
 
# faces
f 1 3 2
f 1 2 4
f 1 3 4
f 2 3 4
```

In our project, there is also a simple script in python wicht accept a `.obj` file as input and generate a `.txt` file as output with the pref√¨vious features.
